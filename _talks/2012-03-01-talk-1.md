Abstract:
The return‑stroke phase of cloud‑to‑ground lightning is central to protection design for above‑ground structures and buried assets. Evaluating subsurface fields commonly uses either a quasi‑static current‑injection model or a full‑wave engineering model, both prescribing currents without accounting for soil electrical properties. A self‑consistent return‑stroke model avoids this limitation, but realistic soils necessitate a domain‑based FDTD formulation with key modifications. Using this framework, soil resistivity, dispersion, and ionization are shown to significantly affect fast‑front currents, altering return‑stroke evolution.
